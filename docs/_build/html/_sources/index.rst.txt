StDb Tools - documentation
==========================

StDb is a package containing tools for building a database of station information
from geophysical observatories. The code is used through command-line scripts 
and include several options for querying an online fdsn archive, list 
the content of an existing station database, merge existing databases, and 
manually append new station information (e.g., for stations not hosted on
any fdsn archive). 

The resulting station dictionary is used in various seismic applications, 
such as `SplitPy <https://github.com/paudetseis/SplitPy>`_ and ``RfPy``.
